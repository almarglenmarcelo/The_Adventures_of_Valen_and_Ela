LESSON 6
NOTE: VOICE RECORD AND LAYOUTING ONLY LEFT. NEED TO UPDATE THE ALPHABETICAL BOX THINGY ON FINAL CHALLENGE. GRAMMARS ARE ALL FIXED.

1: Learning Competency: 
At the end of this material, you should be able to compare numbers using relation symbols and orders numbers up to 1000 in increasing or decreasing order.

2: Let's Learn!
The following are the relational symbols that are used in comparing numbers:
> Greater than (bigger number) is used if the number on the left side is greater than the number on the right side
< Less than (smaller number) is used if the number on the right side is less than the number on the left side.
= Less than (smaller number) is used if the number on the right side is less than on the left side.

3: Take all these examples!
Greater Than (>)

4: For 765 > 98, count the digits in each number. More digits are a more significant number. 765 (3-digit number) has more digits than 89 (2-digit number).

5. For 253 > 163, if the number of digits in two numbers is the same, compare the one with the highest place value. 2 is greater than 1.

6: Less Than (<)

7: For 39 < 123, count the digits in each number. Fewer digits, smaller numbers. 39 (2-digit number) has fewer digits than 123 (3-digit number).

8: For 304 < 403, if the number of digits in two numbers is the same, compare the one with the highest place value. 3 is smaller than 4.

9: Equal (=)

10: When it comes to 410 = 410, Compare all digits. If the digits are the same number, the numbers are equal or equal or equal in number.

11: How about we try learning it through word problems?

12: Ana has 543 pesos, Rene has 541 pesos, and Ime has 478 pesos. Who has the least, and who has the biggest money?

13: Compare 543 and 521.
[yung chart, no need to voice over]

14: Compare digits in the same place value:
hundreds digits: 5 = 5
tens digits: 4 = 4
ones digits: 3 > 1
Stop when the digits are already different.
So 543 > 541

15: Compare digits in the same place value:
hundreds digits: 5 > 4
So 541 > 478
Ascending Order (from smallest to largest)
478, 541, 543
Descending Order (from largest to smallest)
543, 541, 478

16: Keep in Mind!
In comparing numbers, use the symbols > for greater than, < for less than, and = for equal to. The ascending order in order from smallest to largest. The descending order is arranged from largest to smallest.

17: Take a Challenge!
Arrange the starting numbers in descending order (largest to smallest). Write it on a piece of paper and when you are ready, click the 'next' button to see the answers!

18: Did we get the same answers? If we did, great job! You did it perfectly. :)

19: Be Ready!

20: Now that everything is clear, take a step and defeat the bad villains using the power of Number Sense knowledge! Remember to click the 'Proceed' button below to take the challenge. :)

21: Good luck and I will be waiting for you at the entrance on the next floor!
